# Claude Obsidian Memory

A persistent context and agent workflow system for Claude Code using Obsidian.

Claude Code sessions normally start without the context from your previous work. This setup gives Claude a persistent file-based memory system so it can recover previous sessions, read journal entries, track unfinished tasks, and continue where you left off.
